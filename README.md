I used: 
1. grayscale, blur and opacity
2. @Media
3. object-fit: fill;  
4. Position sticky
5. grid
6. repeat
7. background and other simple css commands

Simple overview:

I made a photo album of Object inspace what could end earth, i used 9 differn't pictures and use grid to align them, 
I also used a hover effect where it rotates 360deg on the x axis, i did a video background with object fit and made it position absolute,
I made a simple footer and nav with a little responsiveness.
